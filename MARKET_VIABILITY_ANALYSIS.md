## 🎲 Market Reality Check

### **The Hard Truth About Lotteries**

1. **Mathematical Reality**:
   - Even "positive EV" lottery tickets are still terrible bets
   - House edge is massive (typically 50-70% against players)

2. **Target Market Size**:
   - **Analytical lottery players**: ~5-10% of lottery players
   - **US lottery players**: ~50-60% of adults (~150M people)
   - **Your target**: ~7.5-15M analytical players
   - **Realistic addressable market**: 1-5% of that = **75K-750K potential users**

3. **Competition**:
   - Free lottery apps (Jackpocket, Lottery.com)
   - Free EV calculators online

   - **Differentiation needed**: Accuracy + automation + insights
